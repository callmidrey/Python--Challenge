# Python-Challenge
This is my Python challenge

This Python Challenge consited of different datasets, one on cahflows for a bank for a peiod of time and another dataset for an election conducted.
The dataset were pretty good as they were clean and no missing data.
Little to no cleaning was done.

# For the Bank Analysis
It can be conferred that the period for which the dataset's data was collected was `86` calender months with a total net inflow of `$22564198`.
Zooming into the monthly inflows, it was averaged to be `$-8311.11`, with the greatest increase to be `$182002`in August 2016 and greatest decrease to be `$-1825558` in February 2014.
The reason for the changes cannot be assessed as there are no additonal data to explore further.

# For the Election Anlysis
It can be concluded that there was a total vote cast of `369711` amongst candidates :
    - Charles Casper Stockham with `85213` votes, Representing  `23.049%` of total vote cast.
    - Diana DeGette with`272892` votes, Representing 73.812% of total vote cast.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane with `11606` votes representing 3.139% of total vote cast.
It can therefore be concluded that the winner by popular votes in this election is Diana DeGette.

# Key Notes
Both datasets were analyszed effectively using loops and conditionals.
The resluts were printed out, saved to terminal and eported to a text file which can be found in their respective Analysis sheet of each folder.
